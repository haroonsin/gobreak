siRNA Treatment Analysis Tool

### siRNA Progression Visualization Project

#### Description

This project aims to visualize siRNA progression into nucleus boundaries. \
siRNA and nucleus are dyed with blue and red dyes respectively. \
Metrics are collated using data captured over various time intervals. \
Data is then plotted using various data visualization techniques in Python. 

#### Input Data Format

The expected dataset should be in a ZIP format containing folders with names corresponding to the time points (e.g., 0, 1, 3, 6). \
Each folder should contain a montage.tif file, which comprises different layers such as:
- Red channel
- Blue channel
- RGB merged layer

#### Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haroonsin/gobreak.git

- Load the ipnb file in Google Colab
```
